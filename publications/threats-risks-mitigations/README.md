# About

The purpose of this document is to build a mutual understanding of the high-level threats,
security risks, and potential mitigations associated with the open source ecosystem. There
is a natural overlap between these threats and risks, and those that affect the more general
software development process.

The primary intended audience consists of members of the
[Open Source Security Coalition](https://github.com/Open-Source-Security-Coalition/Open-Source-Security-Coalition)
and similar organizations interested in promoting and advancing improvements to the security
of the open source ecosystem, but should not be considered as a product roadmap or promised
set of features. It should also be noted that this document focuses exclusively on security
risk and does not include risks related to intellectual property (i.e. patents, copyright,
licensing, contracts).
